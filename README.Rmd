## Description

This package contains a compilation of empirical methods used by farmers and agronomic engineers to predict the minimum temperature to detect a frost event. 

These functions use variables such as environmental temperature, relative humidity, and dew point.

## Installation

If you don't have package **devtools** installed, run the following commands.

`` install.packages("devtools") ``

`` library(devtools) ``

To install the package from the GitHub repo, run

`` install_github("anadiedrichs/frost")``
