[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anadiedrichs/frost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anadiedrichs/frost) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/128426264.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/128426264)

### Description

This package contains a compilation of empirical methods used by farmers and agronomic engineers to predict the minimum temperature to detect a frost event. 

These functions use variables such as environmental temperature, relative humidity, and dew point.

### Installation

If you don't have package *devtools* installed, run the following commands.

`` install.packages("devtools") ``

`` library(devtools) ``

To install the package from the GitHub repo, run

`` install_github("anadiedrichs/frost")``
