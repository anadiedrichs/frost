## Prediction of minimum temperature for frost forecasting in agriculture

### Description

This package contains a compilation of empirical methods used by farmers and agronomic engineers to predict the minimum temperature to detect a frost event. 

These functions use variables such as environmental temperature, relative humidity, and dew point.

### Installation

If you don't have package *devtools* installed, run the following commands.

`` install.packages("devtools") ``

`` library(devtools) ``

To install the package from the GitHub repo, run

`` install_github("anadiedrichs/frost")``

Load the library to start using the functions

`` library(frost) ``

## Dew point estimation

 Given that several methods used dew point as an input variable, this package provides methods to estimate the dew point (in Celsius degree) given ambient temperature and relative humidity.
 
```{r}
library(frost)

temp <- 25
rh <- 54

calcDewPoint(rh,temp,mode="A")
calcDewPoint(rh,temp,mode="B")
calcDewPoint(rh,temp,mode="C")

```

## Prediction of minimum temperature

### FAO approach

```{r}
library(frost)
x1 <- rnorm(100,mean=2,sd=5)
x2 <- rnorm(100,mean=1,sd=3)
y <- rnorm(100,mean=0,sd=2)
buildFAO(dw = x2,temp=x1,tmin=y)
# data example taken from FAO Book
t0 <- c(3.2,0.8,0.2,2.6,4.4,5.2,2.7,1.2,4.5,5.6) # temperature 2 hours after sunset
td <- c(-4.2,-8.8,-6.5,-6.2,-6.1,2.6,-0.7,-1.7,-1.2,0.1) # dew point 2 hours after sunset
tn <- c(-3.1,-5,-6.3,-5.4,-4,-2.5,-4.8,-5,-4.4,-3.3)
out <- buildFAO(dw = td,temp=t0,tmin=tn)

# We use the results of the model to have the coefficients for the formula
current_temp <- 10
current_dw <- 2
predFAO(out$a,out$b,out$c,current_temp,current_dw)


```



```{r}
```

An estimated temperature trend during a frost night.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
library(frost)

plotTrend(Tmin = 22.2,t2 = 33.7,n = 15) # in °F degress
plotTrend(Tmin = -5.45,t2 = 0.95,n = 15) # in °C degress
```

### Empirical formula used in Mendoza


## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```
